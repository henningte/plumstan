Description: \code{plumstan} provides functions in order to
  compute age-depth models for sediment cores based on measured 
  \eqn{^{210}}Pb activities using a Bayesian statistical
  framework developed and implemented in the R package \code{plum}
  by Aquino-LÃ³pez et al (2018). In contrast to \code{plum},
  \code{plumstan} relies on the programming language \code{Stan}
  in order to perform the Bayesian calculations. This has the 
  advantage that the Bayesian model can directly be integrated 
  into more complex models and modified and resulting models can
  be handled using the functions of the \code{rstan} package.
